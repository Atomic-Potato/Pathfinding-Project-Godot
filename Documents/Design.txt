# CORE GAMEPLAY LOOP
The game is an RTS dungeon crawler where you gather all the troops that u can get
before a wave of enemies would come in after a certain timer where you have to build
and defend yourself from that wave.

# SETTING
It is sett inside of a trench warfare, however im not sure if ill make it cartoony and
colorful, or a serious style like metal slug.

# IDEAS
- The wave should not approach until you have at least gathered 75% of troops
- Player can control units anywhere in the dungeon
